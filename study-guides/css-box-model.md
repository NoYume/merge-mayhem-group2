- `width`: This refers to the width of the content area of the element.
- `height`: This refers to the height of the content area of the element.
- `padding`: Directly surrounding the content area of the element is the padding. The **padding** can be divided into four different properties: `padding-top`, `padding-right`, `padding-bottom`, and `padding-left`. Most web browsers give elements a default padding size of `0px`.
- `border`: The **border** is the space between the padding and margin. Developers can modify the `border-color`, `border-style`, and `border-width` of an element. These properties can also be specified to its 4 different edges: `border-top`, `border-right`, `border-bottom`, and `border-left`. Most web browsers give elements a default border size of `0px`.
- `margin`: The **margin** is the outermost space directly surrounding the border. The margin can be divided into four different properties: `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, and `margin-left`. Most web browsers give elements a default margin size of `16px`.
